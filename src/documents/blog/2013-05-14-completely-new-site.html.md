I've completely changed the layout and code behind this site at least 37 times in the last 14 days.  I think I've finally settled on what I want.  I want to thank the folks behind [DocPad](http://docpad.org) and specifically [Benjamin Laupton](http://balaupton.cc).  This site is built with DocPad and the boilerplace I started with was his site.  I'll gradually be making it my own over the next few forevers, but his provided a great start.
